You will partner with business and technical partners to triage and fix security issues during the course of an incident. We trust you to focus your time and efforts where they are needed most to drive initial remediation work. You will continue to identify ways we can improve our response times and gathering the right digital forensics to conduct effective post-mortems so we learn from past events.<br>\n<br>\nYou won’t do this alone. The security team as a whole will work to evolve our defenses as a whole, not just in response to security events but to find effective ways to prevent issues from arising in the first place with your front-line input.<br>\n<br>\nWe’re looking specifically for engineers who place an emphasis on usable security. Stitch Fix is a fast-growing company, and our security program needs to be able to keep pace with that growth while not disrupting innovation. You will help us improve our response effectively in driving our Incident Response maturity. You will drive efforts to prototype, implement, test, deploy and maintain initial response solutions and processes. You will conduct post-mortems with various stakeholders, clearly explaining your decisions and how they address actual risks and known issues, incorporating feedback in subsequent iterations.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>Requisite Skills And Experience<br>\n</u></strong><ul> <li>At least 2+ years in Security, preferably in an Incident Response role or similar “first responder” role (Trust and Safety, Fraud, Account Protection, etc) </li> <li>Demonstrated experience with common logging software (Splunk, SumoLogic, Datadog or similar)</li> <li>Understanding of common adversarial tools and techniques and IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) preferred</li> <li>Demonstrated capability to follow and drive response outcomes</li> <li>Strong ability to be calm “under fire” and drive solutions in a time-sensitive environment when under stress or urgency</li> <li>Strong written communication skills when completing post-mortems</li> <li>Strong partnership and soft skills to influence outside of the Security organization to cooperation and resolution during security events</li> <br>\n<br>\n</ul><strong><u>You’re Excited About This Opportunity Because...<br>\n</u></strong><ul> <li>We work collaboratively as both a centralized and distributed team —we are a combined team of both remote and HQ-based professionals. We use a variety of technologies extensively to collaborate with each other.</li> <li>You will have the opportunity to drive security solutions in a cloud-native environment at scale</li> <li>We view Security as an enabling part of the business which requires a purposeful strategy through an overarching vision of how security can support the organization’s goals.</li> <li>You are a Problem Solver. Ultimately, anyone can say “no” to something —but just saying “no” isn’t solving a problem. Figuring out a compromise, like preserving or even improving an experience while still ensuring an organization’s security, is a hard problem — the type of problem which should be the most intellectually fulfilling.</li> <br>\n</ul>We use these tools and techniques to help us get the job done and we’re excited to share our expertise with new members of the team. You will have the opportunity to help us continue to adopt effective practices and technologies and explore their full potential.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>We Are Excited About You Because...<br>\n</u></strong><ul> <li><strong>YOU ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT SECURITY.</strong> You will collaborate to build interesting security solutions using the appropriate tools and contribute to design and architecture across multiple systems. You want to build on your experience and help us to adopt new technologies. You'll learn from us, and we'll learn from you. You care deeply about the fighting to secure our clients and our employees from threats. </li> <li><strong>YOU HAVE A PARTNERSHIP MINDSET.</strong> Our team works together with multiple stakeholders to deliver projects that use secure technologies and processes to solve real business problems. Your team members and business partners will seek out your opinion on the focus and outcome you’re looking to achieve. You aren’t afraid to dig deep and ask the tough questions of our customers, company, and executive team.</li> <li><strong>YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BEING A FIRST RESPONDER.</strong> You should strongly believe that every second matters during a security event or incident, and you’re the first to jump in to do the hard work required to keep us safe. </li> <li><strong>YOU HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR YOUR CRAFT.</strong> We are dedicated to building security sustainably, not chasing the latest fad but understanding the best solution for the problem. You're always looking for more and better ways to bake security into everyday processes, and enthusiastic about sharing them with your team.</li> <li><strong>YOU ARE RESPECTFUL, EMPATHETIC, AND HUMBLE.</strong> We want you to take your work seriously and be open to personal and professional growth. Successful security professionals show everyone respect and consideration.</li> <br>\n</ul><strong>YOU'LL LOVE WORKING AT STITCH FIX BECAUSE WE...<br>\n</strong><ul> <li>Are a successful, vibrant, fast-growing company</li> <li>Are a technologically and data-driven business.</li> <li>Are at the forefront of tech and fashion, redefining shopping for the next generation.</li> <li>Are passionate about our clients and live/breathe the client experience.</li> <li>Get to be creative every day.</li> <li>Have a smart, experienced, and diverse leadership team that wants to do it right &amp; is open to new ideas.</li> <li>Believe in autonomy &amp; taking initiative.</li> <li>Have sunny offices in downtown San Francisco, CA, Austin, TX and Pittsburgh, PA, or your home :)</li> <li>Offer transparent, equitable, and competitive compensation based on your level to help eliminate bias in salaries, as well as equity and comprehensive health benefits.</li> <li>Are serious about our commitment to life-work balance, and have generous parental leave policies.</li> <br>\n<br>\n</ul><strong><u>About Stitch Fix<br>\n<br>\n</u></strong>At Stitch Fix, we’re about personal styling for everybody and we believe in both a service and a workplace where you can be your best, most authentic self.
